# Backup and Disaster Recovery Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the backup and disaster recovery strategy for the GreenOps Advisor application. The strategy includes regular backups of critical data, configuration files, and application state to ensure business continuity in case of failures.

## Backup Components

### 1. Database Backups
- **Supabase Database**: Regular backups of the Supabase PostgreSQL database containing metrics, opportunities, and user data
- **Frequency**: Daily full backups, hourly incremental backups
- **Retention**: 30 days of daily backups, 7 days of hourly backups

### 2. Configuration Backups
- **Kubernetes Manifests**: All YAML manifests in the k8s-manifests directory
- **Application Configuration**: Environment files and configuration parameters
- **Frequency**: Version controlled in Git, backed up with each commit

### 3. Application State Backups
- **Persistent Volumes**: Any persistent storage used by the application
- **Frequency**: Daily snapshots

## Recovery Procedures

### 1. Database Recovery
1. Identify the latest good backup
2. Restore the database from the backup
3. Validate data integrity
4. Update application configuration if needed

### 2. Application Recovery
1. Redeploy Kubernetes manifests
2. Restore configuration files
3. Restore persistent volumes if applicable
4. Validate application functionality

### 3. Disaster Recovery
1. Assess the scope of the disaster
2. Activate backup environment if available
3. Restore from the most recent backups
4. Validate all components are functioning
5. Switch traffic to recovered environment
