# Security Runbook

## Overview

This document provides security procedures and best practices for the GreenOps Advisor application.

## Security Controls

### Authentication
- Multi-factor authentication for admin access
- Regular credential rotation
- Strong password policies
- Session management and timeout

### Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access review
- Audit logging for all access

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest for database
- TLS encryption for all network communication
- Secure handling of sensitive data
- Data retention and deletion policies

### Network Security
- Network policies to restrict traffic
- Firewall rules for ingress and egress
- Private network segmentation
- Regular security scanning

## Security Monitoring

### Log Analysis
- Centralized log collection
- Real-time log monitoring
- Anomaly detection
- Alerting for security events

### Vulnerability Management
- Regular vulnerability scanning
- Dependency security scanning
- Patch management process
- Security advisory monitoring

### Intrusion Detection
- Network intrusion detection
- Host-based intrusion detection
- File integrity monitoring
- Behavioral analysis

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Classification
- **Critical**: Data breach, system compromise
- **High**: Unauthorized access, malware detection
- **Medium**: Policy violations, suspicious activity
- **Low**: Minor policy violations, false positives

### Response Procedures

#### Critical Incidents
1. Immediate containment
2. Preserve evidence
3. Notify security team
4. Engage incident response team
5. Document all actions
6. Post-incident review

#### High Incidents
1. Assess impact
2. Contain threat
3. Investigate root cause
4. Apply remediation
5. Document findings
6. Update procedures

#### Medium/Low Incidents
1. Log incident
2. Investigate
3. Apply fixes
4. Close incident
5. Review for improvements

## Compliance
